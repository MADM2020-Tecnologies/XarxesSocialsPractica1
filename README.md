### TO DO

**1)** The file **facebook_sample_anon.txt** is a data table containing the list of edges of an anonymized  sample of the Facebook friendship network. Download it on your computer,  upload it to R as a dataframe, and define an undirected graph with this list of edges.

*a)* Is it connected? If it is not, replace it by its largest connected component.

*b)* Compute the edge density.

*c)* What is the mean distance among the subjects?

*d)* Calculate the list of vertices in a diameter of the graph. Plot only this path with the size of the node proportional to the degree of the node.

*e)* Calculate the shortest path from the vertex named "1000" to the vertex named "2000" in the original file.

*f)* Calculate a clique of  5 friends, if there is one.

*h)* Calculate the list of names of verteces that are the neigbours of verteces of degree one and that are not of degree one.
